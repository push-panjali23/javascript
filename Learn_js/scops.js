// JavaScript variables have 3 types of scope:

// Block scope

// JavaScript variables had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

// ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
// These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
// Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

// Local Scope

// Variables declared within a JavaScript function, are LOCAL to the function:

// Function scope

// JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
// Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
// Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.

// Global scope

// A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.
// Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
// Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
